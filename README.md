# Project 4 -- Wordfinder puzzle
Homework for the child-1, find a 100 English words in a 35 by 35 grid. Score break-down:
* first 21 found by child-1
* next 55 found by v1 algorithm (no diagonal up finder + few edge-bugs)
* next 5 found by mother, manually
* next 18 found by v2 algorithm (added coarse diagonal up finder)
* the last one, shelf, was found by grandmother-1 via chat-group! (edge-bug prevented the algorithm)
